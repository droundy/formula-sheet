OSU Physics formula sheets
==========================

These are the formula sheets for the comprehensive exam at Oregon
State University.  You can build both the SI and cgs versions by just
typing `make`.  If you want to edit them, please edit
`formula_sheet.tex` rather than the generated tex files.
